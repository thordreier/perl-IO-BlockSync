=head1 NAME

IO::BlockSync - Syncronize changed blocks

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.002

=head1 SYNOPSIS

BlockSync can some of the same stuff that bigsync (by Egor Egorov) can
- it's just written in perl.

BlockSync copies data from source file to destination file (can be a block
device) and calculates checksum on each block it copies.
On all runs after the first only the changed blocks will be copied.

Perl module:

    use IO::BlockSync;
    BlockSync( src => 'sfile', dst => 'dfile', chk => 'cfile' );

Executable:

    blocksync -s /source/file -d /destination/file
